    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper together in a large bowl until combined. Form into 8 balls and flatten into patties.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add patties and onion; fry until patties are nicely browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer beef patties to a plate, and keep warm.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle flour over onions and drippings in the skillet. Stir in flour with a fork, scraping bits of beef off of the bottom of the skillet as you stir. Gradually mix in beef broth and sherry. Season with seasoned salt. Simmer and stir over medium-low heat until gravy thickens, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low, return patties to the gravy, cover, and simmer until cooked through, about 15 minutes.</li>
</ol>
