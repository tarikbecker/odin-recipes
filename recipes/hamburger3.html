    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>6 (4 ounce) cube steaks (pounded round meat)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced into strips</li>
        <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        <li>
            Heat the oil in a Dutch oven, or deep iron skillet. Dredge steaks in some of the flour, reserving the rest
            of the flour.
            Brown steaks in the oil a few at a time, and remove to a plate. When all of the steaks are browned, place a
            layer of
            sliced onions into the Dutch oven, and alternate layers of steak and onion. Pour in beef stock and
            Worcestershire sauce.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cover, and bake for 2 hours in the preheated oven. Remove steaks and onions from the pan, and whisk in 2
            tablespoons of
            the remaining flour. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook, stirring until thickened. Serve steaks and
            onions with
            gravy with mashed potatoes or noodles.
        </li>
    </ol>
